# TMS Captcha autofiller [Chrome extension]

![screenshot of this project](screenshot.png)

About ten lines of JS code which make it so that you never have to manually input TMS's captcha again (at least till they change the implementation).

Read the corresponding blog post at [nirav.com.np](https://nirav.com.np/2021/05/22/the-tms-website-sucks-so-i-made-a-captcha-autofiller.html)

# Important update: 

Seems like some brokers changed their implementation of captcha system (but not mine hehehe) so it might not work for me.

## "I want this!"
