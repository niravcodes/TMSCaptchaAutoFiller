# TMS Captcha autofiller [Chrome extension]

![screenshot of this project](screenshot.png)

About ten lines of JS code which make it so that you never have to manually input TMS's captcha again (at least till they change the implementation).

# Important update: 

Seems like some brokers changed their implementation of captcha system (but not mine hehehe) so it might not work for me.

## "I want this!"

**Update:** The extension is now available in [Google Extension store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tms-captcha-autofiller/bbnmlbcjjojlcigkphmancneeplopmhg). So you can download the app from official Google channel. [Download Here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tms-captcha-autofiller/bbnmlbcjjojlcigkphmancneeplopmhg)

**Update 2:** My broker has also changed the implementation of their captcha system. May this little extention rest in peace ✌️
